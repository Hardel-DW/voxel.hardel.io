# December 2025 Update

A massive update with tons of new content! This month brings a brand new mod, new addons, and a complete overhaul of all my tools and website.

---

# New Content

## Whisper of Ether

My first full mod is here! **Whisper of Ether** introduces the **Runic System**, a new way to customize your equipment through runes with unique stats like Multi Jump, Omnivampirism and Critical Strikes.

Currently in alpha for Patreon members. Check out the [Whisper of Ether patch notes](https://voxel.hardel.io/patchnote/woe) for all the details.

---

## NeoEnchant: Enchanting Table Addon

New addon that makes **100% of NeoEnchant enchantments** available directly in the enchanting table. This may be unbalanced but perfect for casual play.

Check out the [NeoEnchant 5.13.0 patch notes](https://voxel.hardel.io/patchnote/neoenchant) for all the details.

---

## Yggdrasil Alternative & Alfheim Nether Tree

**Yggdrasil Alternative** is a dimension-free version optimized for multiplayer servers, fully compatible with Paper, Bukkit and Purpur.

Includes the new **Alfheim Nether Tree** that provides access to the Nether roof, where all runic structures have been relocated. See the [Yggdrasil patch notes](https://voxel.hardel.io/patchnote/yggdrasil) for all the details.

# Website Overhaul

The website **voxel.hardel.io** has been completely rewritten! New patch notes pages make it easier to browse the latest features for each project.

---

# Tools Update

## Voxel Studio (Coming Soon)

The Enchantment Configurator has been temporarily disabled. It will return in a few days as **Voxel Studio**, a more powerful tool for editing datapacks — not just enchantments.

## New Tools Website

All tools have been moved to a new dedicated site: **labs.hardel.io**. Both tools have been rebuilt visually and technically.

---

## Converter

Now supports multiple files at once with a fresh new visual style.
