# December 2024 Update
I am happy and pleased to present today a major update with its share of new features for our various projects.

## NeoEnchant: A Presentation Page
The NeoEnchant presentation page gets a new look with a complete visual overhaul. The interface is now more modern and intuitive, and allows to display more information.

## Yggdrasil: Exploration and Discoveries
Yggdrasil expands with the introduction of the runic dimensions as well as plenty of new structures to explore. I hope you will enjoy this new adventure.

## Interactive Documentation
Additionally, Yggdrasil receives a web page that allows you to consult in detail the rewards in each structure. This transparency will allow you to better plan your explorations.

## In Conclusion
This December update represents an important milestone for us. Although the pace of new features will temporarily slow down.
Don't hesitate to join [Discord](https://discord.gg/TAmVFvkHep) to share your feedback on all these new features or to follow future updates.
Thank you for your understanding and continued support!
