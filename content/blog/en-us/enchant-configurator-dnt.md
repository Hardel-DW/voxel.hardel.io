# A Major Collaboration
I am delighted to announce that the Enchantment Configurator now officially supports **Dungeons & Taverns**. It's a structure datapack with over 3 million downloads on Modrinth, which is really very impressive and immersive.

## What is the Enchantment Configurator?
If you don't know Voxel, let me introduce you to the Enchantment Configurator, it's a tool that allows you to modify the enchantments of a mod or datapack, with a possible simple interface for everyone. Here are the features:
- Disable an enchantment
- Modify the effects of an enchantment
- Modify the probabilities of appearance or balance
- Define in which structures the enchantment can be found
- Modify the items that can support the enchantment
- Modify compatibilities between enchantments

## And what about Dungeons & Taverns?
You can now define in which DnT structures an enchantment can be found, allowing you to customize your gaming experience.



# An Enriched Gaming Experience
The integration of Dungeons & Taverns opens up new possibilities, you can make an enchantment exclusive to certain structures, which allows you to modify the difficulty of obtaining an enchantment.

## Future Goals
Our vision remains the same, facilitating access to a customizable gaming experience, and better compatibility between content.



# Join Witches Cauldron
I invite you to discover the projects of **"Witches Cauldron"** and follow their creations. This collaboration is important to me, and I hope to extend support to other packs in the future:
