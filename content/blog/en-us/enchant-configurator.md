# Unleash your creativity with the Enchantment Configurator
The **Enchantment Configurator** is a tool that allows you to modify and customize enchantments of content **(Mods and datapack)** and not just those created by Voxel.   
Whether you use popular content or a personal creation, this tool gives you full control over enchantment configuration and allows you to customize your gaming experience.

### A tool for everyone
You now ask, what can you do with the Enchantment Configurator?
- Disable an enchantment
- Modify the maximum level of enchantments, their rarity and level cost
- Make an enchantment exclusive to the creative menu
- Modify how an enchantment is obtained
- Indicate which items can support the enchantment
- Indicate in which structures the enchantment can be found
- Indicate compatibilities between enchantments

As you can see, it has been designed for the general public, the tool offers you the flexibility to modify enchantments in a simple, intuitive, and minimalist way, previously reserved for experienced developers.

### Always up to date with the latest features
I am committed to continuously improving the Enchantment Configurator with more features, and keeping it up to date with the latest version of Minecraft.
