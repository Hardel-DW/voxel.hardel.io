# Interactive Documentation for Yggdrasil
I am delighted, (I always am, it's crazy Just Kidding) to present you the new interactive documentation for Yggdrasil, designed to make your gaming experience more transparent and intuitive.

## Structure Exploration
The new documentation allows you to **View each structure in detail** and **Check available loot by block type**.

## Loot System by Block
This new documentation system allows for precise exploration:
- You can click on any reward block (Shulker, Chest, Trial Spawner, Vault, Pottery) to see its contents
- You can view the probabilities of obtaining each item **(Coming Soon)**
- You can also see appearance conditions, or additional information
