# Version 1.3.0 - Migrate to Breeze

## Breeze
Breeze is a dependency of Voxel, all the logic of the Voxel engine has been moved to this dependency, thanks to this, we can now use the Voxel engine in other projects. The Breeze source code is available on GitHub.
Concretely, nothing changes for you, it is an internal update of Voxel.

## Interface change
- Some components are now more detailed and offer a new look, it's subtle but the details make all the difference :3
- The interface is now more responsive, it adapts to all screen sizes
- The sidebar is now smaller for small screens
- Shadcn/UI components are removed for a homemade solution
