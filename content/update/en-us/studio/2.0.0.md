# Version 2.0.0 - Voxel Studio

## Welcome to Voxel Studio!
Hi everyone, it's been a long time—practically a year or more since version 2 has been in the works. I pushed it back month after month to finally release it. Here is everything that's coming and everything that's changing.

As you can see, the **Enchantment Configurator** has been renamed **Studio** and moved to a separate site. This isn't just cosmetic; this new tool aims to let you modify the entire game from a single place.

# New Features
I have a ton of new features to show you. Let's start with the most visible ones: the interfaces and the new pages.

---

### Interface:
The new interface is much more modern. The old one was very limiting for future possibilities. This one wasn't just designed for the present, but for years to come. All upcoming features have been thought out to be easily integrated.

### New Pages:
- **Studio** now supports **recipes** and **loot tables**. You can configure and test them directly within the interface. I tried to make it as accessible as possible.

- Coming very soon: you will be able to **view the list of modifications** you make at the top of the sidebar, allowing you to cancel or review your changes.

- Added "Overview" pages, allowing you to easily view all resources and disable them if needed.

- Added a code visualization page, which lets you compare changes before and after in terms of code. This is very useful for debugging.

- That's not all. For enchantments, it is possible to **run concrete simulations** identical to those in-game, and obtain a probability distribution table for a specific item.
-# This required digging through the game's math and code. It was hard, with over a dozen parameters to take into account.

### The New Features:
I'll review the features in a condensed way. There are many, so I will skim over the most important ones.

- **Github Integration**: You can now fetch a project. Make your changes and update your project in one click, or create a "Pull Request" to propose your changes to the community.
- **Datapack to Mod Conversion**: If you start with a .zip format, it is now possible to transform your datapack into a mod, and vice versa.
- **New Search Sidebar**: The new bar is adapted to each concept. For enchantments, you can search by slots, items, or incompatible enchantments. It is extremely handy for finding what you need quickly.
- **Enchantment Finder Page**: This page sees some new parameters previously found in the advanced page. Some elements have been moved to the advanced page.
- **Incompatible Enchantments**: A complete overhaul of how this works. You can now define if an enchantment belongs to a group or if it targets one, allowing you to mimic the game's behavior closely.
-# Concretely: You define an enchantment group A, B, C. By themselves, these groups do nothing. Then, you define that enchantment D targets this group. D will be incompatible with A, B, and C. In theory, if an enchantment E targets this same group, it will be incompatible with A, B, and C, but D and E will be compatible.

# Coming Soon:
Support for all missing concepts: **Advancements**, **Structures**, **Custom Banners**, **Mob Variants**, **Equipment**, **Jukebox Songs**, and many others.

An important feature: **Updating from one version to another**, in a single click!

**An integrated code editor**, in the form of an IDE, allowing direct file editing, along with an associated "Node" editor.

**Patch** creation: instead of modifying the pack, this will create a new pack that applies the modifications, allowing you to update the original without losing your changes.

# Voxel Studio Pro:
We are leaving the web to arrive on your desktop. It's the same concept as Voxel Studio, but with extra features.
- Direct access to your folders; interact directly with your files.
- No more data loss if you refresh the page. Here, data is stored on your computer.
- Access to your worlds and Modrinth, CurseForge launchers, and more.
- Much higher performance. A huge amount of information will be stored on your computer, considerably improving speed and fluidity.
- A tab system to navigate between different concepts.

# Technical:
One year for this—is it not that exceptional?

The entire future has been planned for a year: how to integrate new features, both visually and technically. A good number of technologies had to be invented, and I will soon own 100% of the chain. Here is what I developed:

- **Breeze**: The Voxel Studio engine. It has been redeveloped and is now stable and clean. It was rewritten many times to reach a form I can no longer improve.
- **Logger**: A technology to track modifications on any concept, save, and restore data.
- **Action**: A new format allowing interaction with concepts.
- **SNBT**: A library to navigate and edit structure, player, or world files. This is a proprietary Mojang format, useful for structure management.
- **Differ**: A technology to compare files before/after and reorder lines while preserving added functionality. It also identifies differences between files.
- **Markdown**: This technology is right before your eyes; it generates documentation pages, text size, and layout. What you are reading now is managed by this technology.
- **Parser**: The most complicated technology of the bunch. It "parsers" datapacks/mods/resourcepacks to generate a graph of links between files. It tells you which files depend on what and tracks the impact of deletions.
- **Zip**: A library to manipulate zip and jar files (read/write), rewritten for the modern web with exceptional speeds.
- **Converter**: Allows converting a datapack into the mod format.
- **Deploy**: A technology to visually or automatically deploy the project to Modrinth or CurseForge. It will be integrated into Voxel Studio for updates after modifications.
- **Renderer**: A project to get all Minecraft block and item visuals in .pog files, usable for the web.
- **Atlas**: Generates an image containing all block and item images, allowing instant loading in the browser.
- **Voxel Api**: Connects you to Github. It is the Voxel Studio server.

Wow! That's a lot of technology, but it's so Voxel Studio can be as performant as possible. What is missing concretely?
- **Voxel Updater**: A technology to automatically update Datapacks/Mods/Resourcepacks from one version to another. Imagine going from 1.20 to 1.21.1 in a single click.
- **Voxel Structure**: An algorithm to place and generate the visual of a structure. It is a complex project, but one that will offer tons of tools.
- **Voxel Rendering**: This last project will allow displaying 3D models of Items and blocks directly in Voxel Studio. This is important.
