# Version 2.1.0 - Changes & Translations

## Overview
This update focuses on three major areas: a complete redesign of the export/settings interface, a massive overhaul of the translation system. and a brand new page to visualize all your modifications.

# Interface Redesign

### Export
The Export button has been completely reimagined. Instead of a small popover, it now opens a fullscreen modal with a clean, minimal design.

The new export interface contains only what matters:
- **Format selection** - Choose your export format
- **Support buttons** - Ways to support the project
- **Download button** - An oversized white button, impossible to miss

### GitHub Integration
All GitHub-related features have been relocated to a dedicated button between Export and Settings. This comes with:
- **Dedicated pages** for repository management
- **Simplified design** - Cleaner and more intuitive
- No more cluttered popovers

### Settings Dialog
The Settings button now opens a proper dialog instead of a popover. Currently contains language selection, with more options coming soon.

-# The debug page previously accessible in settings has been removed.

# Translation System Overhaul

A massive refactor of the translation system across Voxel Studio.

### For Users
- **100% of texts are now translated** - No exceptions, everything is localized
- **Instant language switching** - Change languages without reloading the page
- **No data loss** - Your modifications are preserved when switching languages

### Technical Improvements
- All translation keys are now loaded at once, eliminating the previous split-loading approach
- Reduced bundle size and improved performance
- Pages outside of Studio benefit from the same system like Harmonization/Converter, home pages and all other pages...

# Changes Page

The most important addition of this update. You can now visualize exactly what Voxel Studio is doing to your packs.
This new page shows:
- Which files are modified
- What changes will be applied
- The exact impact on your datapacks

### Four View Modes

| View | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Differences** | See line-by-line changes compared to the original file |
| **Debug Views** | Two debug pages for technical inspection |
| **Code Editor** | An experimental integrated code editor, built from scratch with no external dependencies |

-# The code editor is experimental. It allows direct file editing within Voxel Studio.

# Performance & Bug Fixes

### React Optimizations
A significant effort has been made to eliminate unnecessary re-renders across the application. Many components that were re-rendering on every interaction are now properly optimized, resulting in drastically improved performance.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Discord links now pointing to the correct server (sorry about that!)
- New loading skeletons based on the updated design
- Numerous navigation and interface bugs have been squashed
