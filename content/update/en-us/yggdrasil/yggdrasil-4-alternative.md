# What Makes Alternative Different?

## No Custom Dimensions
The most significant change: **all custom dimensions have been removed**. This eliminates the primary source of compatibility issues with various server software and significantly reduces performance overhead.

### Runic Dimension Relocated
All Runic dimension structures have been relocated to the Nether:
- **Runic Labyrinth**: Now accessible from the Nether roof
- **Alfheim Nether Tree** - Provides access to Nether roof
- **Cuboid**: Relocated to the Nether roof
- **Runic Island**: Relocated to the Nether roof
- **Dokkalfar Ruins** - Nether roof

## Simplified Reward System

### Copper Chests Replace Vaults
Trial vaults and ominous trial vaults have been replaced with copper chests. This change:
- **Eliminates vault-related bugs** that affected some players
- **Improves compatibility** across different server implementations
- **Simplifies gameplay** while maintaining reward quality
- **Reduces technical overhead** on servers

### Removed Items and Systems
The following items and systems have been removed :
- **Divine Keys**: No longer needed with the new copper chest system
- **Vault Keys**: Removed along with vaults
- **Divine Villagers**: The 5 key-exchange villagers have been removed
- **Reva (Familiar)**: The shoulder-perching companion has been removed

## Modified Quests and Removed Content
Quests that previously required vault keys or divine keys have been modified:
- **Asflors Quest**: Updated to work with the new copper chest system
