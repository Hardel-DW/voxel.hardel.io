# A Major Collaboration
We are thrilled to announce that the Enchantment Configurator now officially supports **Dungeons & Taverns**, the most popular structure datapack in the Minecraft community with over 3 million downloads on Modrinth!

## What is the Enchantment Configurator?
It's a tool that allows you to customize enchantments from mods or datapacks according to your preferences, with the simplest possible interface. In just a few clicks, you can:
- Disable an enchantment
- Modify enchantment effects
- Adjust anvil costs and appearance probabilities
- Define in which structures your enchantments can be found
- Modify which items can be enchanted
- Modify enchantment compatibilities

## What's New?
This update integrates **addon support**, and our first addon is the famous **Dungeons & Taverns**. You can now define in which structures from this datapack your enchantments can be found.

# An Enhanced Gaming Experience
The integration of Dungeons & Taverns opens up new possibilities to customize your adventure:
- Create structure-exclusive enchantments
- Balance game progression by adjusting enchantment availability
- Make certain structures more appealing with rare enchantments

## Future Goals
Our vision is to:
- Facilitate access to a customizable gaming experience
- Collaborate with more structure datapack creators
- Create an ecosystem where players can easily modify their gaming experience

# Join Witches Cauldron
We invite you to discover **"Witches Cauldron"** projects and follow their exciting content. This collaboration is just the beginning, and we plan to extend support to other popular structure datapacks. Here's what they've already accomplished:
- **Dungeons & Taverns** - Adding tons of new structures perfectly integrated into Minecraft.
- **Cliff under a Tree** - A datapack that adds new biomes and brings a fresh touch to existing biomes while staying true to Minecraft's vanilla spirit.
- **Endercon** - End generation overhaul focusing on level design and variety.
