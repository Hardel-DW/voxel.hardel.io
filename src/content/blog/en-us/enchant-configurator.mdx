# Unleash Your Creativity with the Enchantment Configurator
The **Enchantment Configurator** is a tool that allows you to modify and customize enchantments in any Minecraft datapack, not just those in the Voxel ecosystem.  
Whether you're using a popular third-party pack or a custom creation, this tool gives you full control over your enchantments, enabling you to tailor them to your unique gameplay style.

### Designed for Everyone for Complete Customization
With the Enchantment Configurator, you can fully customize the enchantments in a pack.
