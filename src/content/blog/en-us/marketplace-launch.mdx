# Launch of the Voxel Marketplace
After weeks of work, Voxel is delighted to announce the launch of the Marketplace. It's a project close to my heart. This project required many hours of work.

## Free Resources for the Community
I am proud to offer you a wide selection of free resources for your personal or commercial projects. This has been created with the same care and attention as other projects, I hope you will enjoy.

## An Exceptional Premium Collection
Beyond the free content it is natural to want to make a living from it, Voxel offers a premium collection that consists of three distinct packs, each on a specific theme:
- **The flame pack** (€3.99): 28 textures on the flaming theme, including a legendary bow, equipment and a ton of thematic resources like flames, rocks, runes.
- **The frozen pack** (€3.99): 33 textures on the frozen theme, with a complete arsenal of icy weapons, it also brings its thematic items, snowflake, ice, shard or frozen leaves.
- **The ice and fire pack** (€7.99): The complete collection including 83 textures, combining the flame and frozen packs with exclusive textures.

## Exclusive Advantage for our Patreons

In recognition of the continued support of our Patreons, I am happy to announce that all three packs are offered free to all our Patreon supporters. It's our way of saying thank you.

## The Future of the Marketplace

This launch is just the beginning. Many projects are under consideration, including new thematic packs.
I want to warmly thank all those who believed in me so that Voxel could propose this project.
