# Voxel Marketplace Launch

After weeks of hard work, Voxel is thrilled to announce the launch of the Marketplace. A project that is particularly close to the team's heart and represents hundreds of hours of creation, refinement, and optimization.

## Free Assets for the Community

We are proud to offer a wide selection of free assets to our community. These resources have been created with the same care and attention to detail as our premium packs, as we firmly believe in supporting everyone's creativity.

## An Exceptional Premium Collection

Beyond the free content, Voxel offers a premium collection consisting of three distinct packs, each bringing its own unique touch to your creations:

- **Flame Pack** (€3.49): 28 flaming textures, including a legendary bow with eternal flames and unique equipment
- **Frozen Pack** (€3.99): 33 frosted textures, with a complete arsenal of icy weapons
- **Ice & Fire Pack** (€7.49): Our complete collection of 83 textures, combining the Flame and Frozen packs with exclusive textures

## Exclusive Benefit for our Patreons

In recognition of our Patreons' continued support, we are pleased to announce that all three premium packs will be offered free of charge to all our Patreon supporters. This is our way of saying thank you to those who believe in our vision and support our work.

## The Future of the Marketplace

This launch is just the beginning. Many projects are under consideration, including new themed packs and regular updates, but this will of course depend on your feedback and suggestions, and most importantly, if this market proves profitable.

I want to warmly thank everyone who believed in me so that Voxel could bring this project to life.

Feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/TAmVFvkHep) to share your creations, ask questions, or simply be part of our growing community.

See you soon on the Voxel Marketplace!
