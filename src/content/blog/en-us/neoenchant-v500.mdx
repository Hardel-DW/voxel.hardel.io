# NeoEnchant+ V5 - The advent of enchantments

## NeoEnchant+ - A complete ecosystem
**NeoEnchant+** is not just a datapack – it's an ecosystem including other packs and software, structures, **a configurator**, and a dedicated presentation page. NeoEnchant+ is the official successor to Technical Enchant+.

### Discover Enchantments Like Never Before
This pack offers a list of enchantments designed for each type of equipment, 45 unique enchantments. Here's a preview of what awaits you:
- **Explosive Arrow**: Explosive arrows were a concept that Notch had planned to add to the game, despite the years, it was never added, that's why we decided to add it in NeoEnchant+.
- **Additional Life**: It is possible to have a second life bar.
- **Mining+**: The famous hammers found in mods and on Paladium, a good way to dig in zones.
- **Auto-Smelting**: A dream of all UHC players, which allows you to automatically smelt your ores.

# Datapack Ecosystem - Yggdrasil & BeyondEnchant
With all these enchantments, the game might be too simple, right?  
That's why NeoEnchant+ is not just a pack – it's an ecosystem here's **Yggdrasil** and **BeyondEnchant**.

- **Yggdrasil** is a pack adding gigantic structures with extreme difficulty, unique rewards, some NeoEnchant+ enchantments are exclusive to these structures, and to make things more fun, monsters use NeoEnchant+ enchantments. GOOD LUCK.  
- **BeyondEnchant** allows you to break vanilla limits. The levels of base game enchantments are all increased, which unlocks new possibilities.
