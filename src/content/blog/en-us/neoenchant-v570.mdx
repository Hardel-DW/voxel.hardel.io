# Overview
**NeoEnchant 5.7.0** introduces 7 new enchantments, including Teluric Wave, Eternal Frost, and more. Also some adjustments to existing enchantments, **performance improvements** by eliminating repeating commands, and adds **French** translations.

## How to get translations
- Place the **NeoEnchant** pack in your resource packs folder.
- Alternatively, you can use the **Voxel Translation** pack, which includes translations for all **Voxel** content (NeoEnchant, Yggdrasil, and future packs).

## Performance Improvements
In the previous version, certain enchantments required commands to be repeated 20 times a second, especially for detection.
These commands have been completely removed, so performance is identical to that of the modded version.
