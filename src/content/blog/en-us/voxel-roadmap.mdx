# Voxel Roadmap - 2025
I'm very excited to present what I have planned for Voxel in 2025 and beyond.
Let's take a tour of 2024 and 2025 to discover Voxel's objectives and the year ahead.

## Update Announcements - Next Week

First, a quick announcement: content updates for Yggdrasil 2.0.0 and NeoEnchant 5.7.0 
will be available next week, including eight new enchantments, reworks, balancing, 
and performance improvements.

Additionally, two new structures: "The Asflors Village" and "The Runic Fracture", 
as well as an "Alfheim" variant: "The Dark Alfheim". This update includes a deep 
storyline, balancing, and unique items.

## The enchantment configurator will also receive an update.

- Support for new structures with a redesign of the Yggdrasil section for more 
customization and simplicity.
- New tabs to manage "non-combinable" enchantments.
- A new "Settings" button to manage datapack information.
- Redesign of texts in certain sections and their explanations.

# Retrospective - 2024

Voxel was initially created to provide resources for programming, Java, modding, 
shaders, resource packs, and datapacks, while deepening the understanding of how 
Minecraft works.

Voxel has shifted course and evolved into a platform providing a Minecraft content 
customization experience, notably through its datapack configurator.

This configurator was initially intended to modify enchantments of any Minecraft 
datapack, and it has undergone several evolutions throughout the year.

- After massive usage, I decided to proceed with an internal rewrite. The goal was 
to transform the project into an engine capable of creating multiple types of 
configurators for any type of Minecraft content.

- Shortly after, a second rewrite phase was undertaken. The goal this time was to 
be able to load the configurator from a simple data file. This feature isn't yet 
exploited, but it will have a significant impact in the future, allowing the use 
of multiple contents simultaneously.

- A few months later, the configurator was extended to support Minecraft mods, 
whether Forge, NeoForge, Quilt, or Fabric, an important milestone.

- And for the end of this year, the configurator recently received huge internal 
evolutions, notably the export of part of the code as JavaScript dependencies, but 
that's too technical to discuss here. I'll write a dedicated article about the 
configurator's internal workings.

# Voxel Studio - New Project

Voxel Studio is under development and will address various needs. Thanks to a 
**Visual Scripting** interface, it allows creating and manipulating datapacks 
without any code. Inspired by powerful tools such as **Unity**, **Unreal Engine**, 
and **Blender**, Voxel Studio offers simple, intuitive, and visual control of your 
creations.

- For users: These tools will be integrated into the configurator to manage complex 
elements, like enchantment effects (balancing, adding new effects, etc.)

- For developers, this will allow you to manage your datapacks, facilitating 
faster, more efficient, and better-organized work.

# Voxelia - Artificial Intelligence

Voxelia is a project intended for the configurator and studio. It will integrate 
artificial intelligence features. From a simple text prompt, you'll be able to 
modify balancing and create content. It will offer suggestions, all while staying 
within the configurator and studio environment.

Concrete example of my vision for Voxelia:

- "Hey, I want to modify the Alfheim structure and add torches to common chests."
- "I want to create an enchantment that allows walking on lava, findable in the 
enchanting table and in the Nether."
- "I want to edit all recipes related to this content (...)."

Moreover, thanks to the previously mentioned "content validation," it theoretically 
won't be able to suggest things that don't exist and will ensure your content 
loads correctly in Minecraft without possible errors. In case of errors, the AI 
will understand the errors sent and apply solutions automatically in the background.

# World Generation Configurator
This will be the central point of 2025. I wish to extend the configurator to more 
content.

I plan to develop everything related to world generation, including **biomes**, 
**structures**, **dimensions**, and **trials spawners**. Specifically:

- You'll be able to disable biomes, structures, and dimensions from a pack with ease.
- Adjust combat difficulty and monsters.
- Modify rewards for balancing.
- (Under consideration) Manage content that generates in a biome, tree density, 
which ores appear and at what layer, etc.

## Future Content Configurator

I remain responsive to snapshots. If Minecraft undertakes to add **custom items** 
or **custom potion effects** for 1.21.4..., or 1.22, this content will become my 
priority and will be supported in the configurator as soon as possible.

## Other Datapack Features

What about other datapack features, that is, the following elements:

- **Advancements**
- **Damage Types**
- **Armor Trims**
- **Wolf Variants**
- **Jukebox Sounds**
- **Banner Patterns**
- **Instruments**
- **Recipes**
- **Predicates**
- **Item Modifiers**
- **Loot Tables**

These elements are simpler to integrate and will be supported in parallel in the 
configurator, without being priorities. Some, like **predicates** and **item 
modifiers**, won't be directly configurable to preserve intuitive and simplified 
use. These technical features will work in the background without requiring your 
intervention.

## Custom Configurator

And one last piece of information: thanks to the configurator's redesign, and as 
it can now load from a data file, datapacks/mods will be able to directly include 
a configurator in their datapacks/mods. This will allow creating custom 
configurators specific to their content.

Here are some examples:

- **Mystical Agriculture**: configurator to manage, modify, add, or remove plants.
- **Productive Bees**: configurator to manage, modify, add, or remove bees.

# Other Projects
Here, I'll present other projects I have in mind for Voxel, two of which are 
already under development but are technical projects.

### Datapacks Upgrader

This project wasn't initially planned, but thanks to recent developments and new 
dependencies in development, this functionality will be simple and quick to 
implement. The goal is to allow converting datapacks from one Minecraft version to 
another without loss of functionality. Misode already offers this service on their 
site, and I wish to develop it as well and integrate it into my internal tools. 
This functionality will be used for the configurator as well as for future 
projects like Voxel Studio, facilitating transition between different Minecraft 
versions.

### Content Validation

Content validation is an intelligent system that analyzes your datapacks and mods 
in the background to automatically detect potential errors. Errors are 
automatically corrected in the background.

### Voxel Desktop - Desktop Application

This is just at the idea stage, but this project is close to my heart. It will 
allow obtaining "Voxel Studio," "Voxelia," and the configurator in a desktop 
application, intended for players but also developers.

This version will be able to directly find the location of your datapacks/mods, a 
significant time saver.

For developers, the interest is being able to continue using your favorite code 
editor and having Voxel in parallel to manage your datapacks/mods like with Unity. 
You can modify your scripts and see changes in real-time in the application.

# Voxel Funding

Voxel is a recent project, and I won't hide that means of living from it are 
non-existent, but despite everything, I love what I do and what we've been able 
to bring to the Minecraft ecosystem.

I wish to integrate a way to live from this project, but I haven't yet found the 
ideal way. What's planned is to continue exclusivities on Patreon, but also to 
include Adsense, but not in an intrusive way. I wish to have a balance like 
Modrinth has achieved.

# Conclusion

So, that's Voxel for 2024 and 2025. I'm very happy to present all this to you and 
I can't wait to show you all these features. If you have any questions or 
suggestions, don't hesitate to share them with me. Thank you for reading and see 
you soon on Voxel.
