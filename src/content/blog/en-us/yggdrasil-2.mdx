# Alfheim
The Ominous Alfheim, accessible only with ominous potions, introduces a new level of challenge. Monsters in this realm now wield vanilla enchantments and are more frequently equipped with powerful equipment. All creatures here have developed immunities to fire, knockback, and fall damage, making them formidable opponents. 

New monsters appear in this version, like the Warden, and the Ominous keys found only in this mode offer real advantages for the rest of your adventure.
