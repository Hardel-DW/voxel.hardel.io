# Helheim
Helheim, in Norse mythology, is the world of the dead. Historically, it is located in the Realm of Niflheim, where Hel, daughter of Loki, is the goddess of this realm.
In Yggdrasil, the story of this mythology is completely different, and you'll be able to discover it while playing. Helheim integrates the first part of the main storyline.

### Information 
- **Access**: Helheim is accessible in caves anywhere in the normal world, it is not visible from the surface.
- **Story**: The 1st part of the main storyline is in Helheim, where you'll follow the story from Hel's perspective and understand the existence of this world.
- **Difficulty**: The difficulty is quite high, identical to Alfheim, with powerful enemies equipped with gear and enchantments.
- **Sinister Version**: Helheim has a sinister version just like Alfheim, making the gameplay more difficult, really more difficult.

### Rewards
Helheim's main quest will allow you to obtain a **familiar** named Reva, who will accompany you throughout your adventure, perching on your shoulder.

Additionally, the structure offers interesting rewards: exclusive enchantments (Coming soon with NeoEnchant 5.9.0), Monster Spawners, and the Heavy Core, which allows you to craft a mace.

Detailed information about the rewards will be available soon.

### Visual and Generation Information
This massive structure is entirely dark, featuring Deepslate and Mangrove blocks, along with lanterns to light the way. This structure reaches the size limit of 128x128x128 blocks.

Furthermore, this structure adapts to cave biomes, meaning it will have a different appearance depending on the original biome. Here's an example in a "Lush Cave" biome:

# Runic Island Revamp and Access to the Runic Dimension
The Runic Island has been improved, with the main hall still present with some minor modifications, but the island now features numerous secret passages. These new passages won't be revealed in this update note to avoid spoiling your experience.

However, what I can tell you is that access to the portals leading to the Runic dimension has been moved to a dedicated room. Additionally, no conditions are required to access the Runic dimension, and "The Authentic Rune of Asflors" has been removed.

The island also receives two new narrative books. One next to the lock that guides players on what to do, and others that serve a narrative purpose.

# The 5 Cartography Altars
The addition of cartography altars, these are mini-structures that you can find on the surface, indicating the position of main structures. Each altar is linked respectively to a main structure.
- **Voroblom**: This structure is linked to Glaosheimr
- **Lifblom**: This structure is linked to Alfheim
- **Proto-Fracture**: This structure is linked to the Runic Island
- **Zenflors**: This structure is linked to Asflors
- **Helblom**: This structure is linked to Helheim

Each structure provides a map to reach the closest corresponding main structure.

And that's it for this update! I can't wait to see you in the structures. The update will be available soon on Modrinth.
