## Features for the Version 1.1.0

Some new features, and some bugs have been fixed.

#### New Features

- A new button named "Mode" in the "General" tab, it allows to define the mode
  of acquisition of enchantments .
  - **Default** : The enchantments can be obtained as they were planned by the
    creator, and of course according to your configuration.
  - **Delete** : For the related enchantments, all effects are removed, and the
    enchantment is no longer obtainable.
  - **Only Creative** : This mode, allows to only obtain the enchantments in
    creative mode.

- In the debug menu, a new border color indicates when an element is deleted
  (Red), new (Green), modified (Gray) or unchanged (Gray).

#### Bug Fixes

- The **Compiler** now correctly deletes files, if it is empty.

### Technical :

- The translation system was rewritten, now it's integrated directly into the
  **Voxel Engine**, previously the website transferred the translations to the
  engine. That means, all web pages are more lighter.
- The **Parser** retrieves the list of all identifiers and put it in the global
  context.
- The **Compiler** determines for each file if it is deleted, new, modified, or
  unchanged.
- Added a new component "Tabs".
- Added a new action named "Alternative" which allows to launch sub-actions
  depending on the equality of a variable.
- Some parts of the code have been rewritten.
