# Version 1.2.0 - Major Update

The Configurator's algorithm has been **completely revamped** with a significant
performance boost and the addition of several **new features**.

## **Error Handling**

**Added an error handling system** for components. In case of an issue, the
application will no longer crash but will simply display the component in error.

## **Re-render Management**

The **Re-render Management** has been **completely overhauled**. Now, components
are updated only when necessary, whereas previously, all components were
refreshed with every interaction.

## **Performance Optimization**

Performance is optimized with a complexity of **O(n)** and **O(1)** instead of
**O(n²)** on average, which means that performance is **1000 times faster** with
each interaction.

## **Other Improvements**

A **"View Developer Data" button** has been added, allowing you to view all the
application's internal data.

- French is now correctly supported. A bug that caused text to be displayed in
  English has been fixed.

### **Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements**

- Fixed a bug that prevented the datapack from loading.
- The list of "Enchantments" in the combination previewer is now **loaded from a
  remote server** instead of being loaded from the client.
